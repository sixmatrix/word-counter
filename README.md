There are several functions which can be used in the Client.java class of the main project.
counterDAO.setFile(); is used to set the file path of the text file.
counterDAO.getWordCount(); is used to extract the word count of the text file.
counterDAO.getFirstNumberForEachLength(); is used to extract the amount of words that appear to be of the specified length.

Make sure that you provide the full path of the file in the counterDAO.setFile() method.
There are several test cases already setup with an example file.

My assumptions:
I have made the assumption that anything that does not include a special character, whitespace or number is considered a word. These characters are removed in order to format these strings.

Enjoy. :)
